2. **Highlight Key Features**
   - Role-based authentication âœ…
   - Multi-AI model support âœ…
   - Rubric-based assignments âœ…
   - Privacy-first design âœ…
   - Instructor feedback interfaces âœ…

3. **Code Walkthrough** (if technical audience)
   - Show `app/utils/ai_client.py` - LiteLLM integration
   - Show `app/routes/instructor.py` - Feedback interfaces
   - Explain aggregation algorithms

### Phase 3: Value Proposition (5 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

1. **Multi-AI Advantage**
   > "Instead of relying on one AI model, FeedForward combines multiple AI engines (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) for balanced, unbiased feedback."

2. **Instructor Control**
   > "AI handles initial assessment, but instructors review and approve all feedback before students see it."

3. **Educational Focus**
   > "Designed specifically for iterative learning - students submit multiple drafts and track improvement over time."

4. **Privacy & Security**
   > "Student content is automatically removed after feedback generation. FERPA-compliant design."

5. **Scalability**
   > "Handle 200 submissions as easily as 20, while maintaining educational quality."

## ðŸ’¡ Demo Scripts & Talking Points

### For Technical Audience:
"Let me show you the architecture. We have a complete FastHTML application with multi-AI integration. The system uses LiteLLM to support any AI provider, implements sophisticated feedback aggregation algorithms, and provides comprehensive instructor oversight interfaces."

### For Educational Audience:
"FeedForward solves the feedback bottleneck in education. Instructors can provide detailed, consistent feedback to all students while maintaining pedagogical control. Students get faster turnaround times and more comprehensive guidance."

### For Administrative Audience:
"This system reduces instructor workload while improving feedback quality. It's scalable to your entire institution and provides data insights to improve educational outcomes."

## ðŸ”§ Demo Troubleshooting

### If Nothing Loads:
1. Check virtual environment is activated
2. Verify all dependencies installed: `pip list | grep fasthtml`
3. Check port 5001 is available: `lsof -i :5001`

### If Database Issues:
1. Delete data directory: `rm -rf data/`
2. Re-run initialization: `python app/init_db.py`

### If Import Errors:
1. Ensure you're in project root directory
2. Check Python path: `python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"`
