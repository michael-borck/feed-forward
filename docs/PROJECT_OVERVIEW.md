# FeedForward Project Overview

## 🎯 System Purpose

FeedForward is an advanced AI-powered feedback system designed specifically for higher education. It transforms how educators provide formative feedback by leveraging multiple AI models to deliver consistent, actionable guidance while maintaining human oversight.

## 🌟 Core Value Proposition

### For Students
- **Personalized Learning**: Receive structured feedback tailored to assignment requirements
- **Iterative Improvement**: Submit multiple drafts with tracked progress and improvement metrics
- **Confidence Building**: Build writing and analytical skills through systematic feedback loops
- **Ownership and Control**: Drafts are retained to power progress tracking, and students control which drafts stay visible in their own view

### For Instructors
- **Scalable Feedback**: Manage large class sizes while maintaining feedback quality
- **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Leverage diverse AI perspectives for comprehensive assessment
- **Quality Control**: Review and refine AI feedback before student access
- **Progress Analytics**: Track student improvement across drafts and assignments

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: FastHTML + HTMX for reactive web interface
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async processing capabilities
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM (production-ready)
- **AI Integration**: LiteLLM for multi-provider AI model support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, accessible UI

### Key System Components

#### 1. Multi-Model AI Processing Pipeline
```
Student Draft → AI Model Pool → Aggregation Engine → Instructor Review → Student Feedback
```

**Features:**
- Configurable runs per model (1-5)
- Multiple aggregation methods (mean, median, trimmed mean, weighted)
- Confidence scoring and transparency
- Model performance tracking

#### 2. Draft Management System
- **Iterative workflow**: Up to 5 drafts per assignment
- **Progress visualization**: Improvement tracking and metrics
- **Comparison tools**: Side-by-side draft analysis
- **Retained history**: Drafts are kept to enable progress tracking, with student-controlled visibility

#### 3. Role-Based Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Granular permissions by role (Student, Instructor, Admin)
- **Data isolation**: Users access only authorized content
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
