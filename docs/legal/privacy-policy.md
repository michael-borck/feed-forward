# FeedForward Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Usage

FeedForward is designed with student privacy as a core principle. We collect and process the following data to provide feedback services:

### Student Information
- Basic account information (name, email)
- Course enrollment details
- Assignment metadata (submissions, dates, word counts)

### Submission Content
- **Temporary storage only**: Student submitted work is stored only temporarily while feedback is being generated
- Once feedback is provided, the original submission content is automatically removed from our system
- We retain only metadata such as word count, submission dates, and generated feedback

## Data Protection Measures

### Submission Privacy
1. **Temporary Storage**: Assignment content is stored only as long as necessary to generate feedback
2. **Automatic Deletion**: After feedback is generated, the content is automatically removed
3. **Metadata Retention**: We keep submission metadata (word count, etc.) for tracking progress
4. **Student Notification**: Students are informed at submission time that their content will be removed

### Technical Measures
1. **Database Security**: All data is securely stored using industry-standard security practices
2. **Secure Processing**: Content is securely processed during the feedback generation phase
3. **Data Minimization**: We collect only what is necessary for the educational purpose

## Student Rights

Students have the following rights regarding their data:
1. **Transparency**: Clear information about how their submissions are processed
2. **Limited Storage**: Assurance that the content of their submissions is not permanently stored
3. **Retention of Own Work**: Students are advised to maintain their own copies of submitted work

## Institutional Use

FeedForward is designed for educational institutions. When deployed by an institution:
1. The institution remains the data controller
2. This privacy policy serves as a baseline that can be extended based on institutional requirements

## Policy Updates

This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices. Major changes will be communicated to users.
