## Overview

FeedForward is designed with a clear educational philosophy: to enhance learning through timely, constructive feedback that guides students toward improvement. This document outlines the core design principles, educational framework, and philosophical approach that shapes every aspect of the platform.

## Educational Philosophy

### Formative Over Summative

FeedForward prioritizes formative assessment—feedback designed to improve learning—over summative assessment that merely judges performance.

```
Traditional Approach:          FeedForward Approach:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Submit → Grade → Done         Submit → Feedback → Revise → Improve

Focus: Final Score            Focus: Learning Process
Timing: End of Learning       Timing: During Learning
Purpose: Judgment             Purpose: Growth
Iterations: One              Iterations: Multiple
```

### Learning Through Iteration

The platform embraces the understanding that good writing (and learning) happens through revision:

```yaml
Iteration Principles:
  Multiple Drafts:
    - 3-5 attempts per assignment
    - No penalty for using all attempts
    - Each draft builds on previous
    
  Progressive Improvement:
    - Track growth over drafts
    - Celebrate incremental gains
    - Focus on trajectory, not position
    
  Reflection Integration:
    - Time between drafts for processing
    - Feedback guides next attempt
    - Meta-cognitive development
```

### Constructive Feedback Focus

All feedback is designed to be:

1. **Specific** - Points to exact areas with examples
2. **Actionable** - Provides clear next steps
3. **Balanced** - Recognizes strengths and areas for growth
4. **Encouraging** - Maintains positive learning environment
5. **Aligned** - Matches rubric criteria and learning objectives

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Student Agency

Students have control over their learning process:

```yaml
Student Controls:
  Submission Timing:
    - Submit when ready
    - Use drafts strategically
    - Learn from each iteration
    
  Privacy Options:
    - Hide unsuccessful attempts
    - Control data visibility
    - Export personal data
    
  Learning Path:
    - Choose revision focus
    - Set personal goals
    - Track own progress
```

### 2. Instructor Empowerment

Instructors maintain pedagogical control while leveraging AI efficiency:

```yaml
Instructor Authority:
  AI Configuration:
    - Select appropriate models
    - Customize feedback style
    - Set evaluation parameters
    
  Quality Control:
    - Review all AI feedback
    - Edit before release
    - Add personal insights
    
  Course Management:
    - Design rubrics
    - Set assignment parameters
    - Control student access
```

### 3. Transparency

All stakeholders understand how the system works:

```yaml
Transparent Elements:
  For Students:
    - Clear rubric criteria
    - Visible scoring methods
    - AI involvement disclosed
    
  For Instructors:
    - AI model behavior
    - Aggregation methods
    - Cost implications
    
  For Institutions:
    - Data handling practices
    - Privacy measures
    - Security architecture
```

### 4. Privacy by Design

Student privacy is fundamental, not an afterthought:

```yaml
Privacy Measures:
  Data Minimization:
    - Temporary content storage
    - Automatic deletion
    - Metadata retention only
    
  Access Control:
    - Role-based permissions
    - No unauthorized sharing
    - Student-controlled visibility
    
  Purpose Limitation:
    - Feedback generation only
    - No model training
    - Clear data boundaries
```

### 5. Accessibility

The platform is designed for diverse learners:

```yaml
Accessibility Features:
  Technical:
    - Screen reader compatible
    - Keyboard navigation
    - High contrast options
    
  Pedagogical:
    - Multiple submission formats
    - Various feedback styles
    - Flexible deadlines
    
  Cultural:
    - Inclusive language
    - Bias mitigation
    - Multiple perspectives
```

## User-Centered Design

  Secondary: Navigation and actions
  Tertiary: System information
  
Color Usage:
  Semantic: Green=success, Yellow=warning, Red=error
  Branded: Institutional colors supported
  Accessible: WCAG AA compliant
  
Typography:
  Headers: Clear hierarchy
  Body: Readable line length
  Code: Monospace for submissions
  Emphasis: Consistent styling
```

### Responsive and Adaptive

Works across devices and contexts:

```yaml
Device Support:
  Desktop: Full functionality

  Progress: Loading indicators, status updates
  Success: Confirmation messages, celebrations
  Error: Clear messages, recovery paths
  
Micro-interactions:
  Smooth transitions
  Meaningful animations
  Delightful moments
  Purposeful motion
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Information revealed as needed:

```yaml
Information Architecture:
  Overview First: Dashboard summaries

  Just in Time: Tooltips and hints
```

## Ethical Design Considerations

### AI Transparency

Users understand AI's role:

```yaml

    - Model names shown
    - Instructor review noted
    
  Limitations Acknowledged:
    - Not replacing instructors
    - May have biases
    - Requires human oversight
```

### Bias Mitigation

Active efforts to reduce bias:

```yaml

## Design Decision Documentation

Key design decisions are captured in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

1. [Educational Workflow Architecture](./adrs/007-educational-workflow-architecture)
2. [Student Submission Privacy](./adrs/008-student-submission-privacy)
3. [UI Framework Selection](./adrs/005-ui-framework-selection)

These documents provide detailed rationale for major design choices.

## Conclusion

FeedForward's design philosophy centers on enhancing learning through thoughtful, iterative feedback. By combining pedagogical best practices with modern technology, the platform creates an environment where students can grow, instructors can teach effectively, and institutions can support educational excellence.

The design principles of student agency, instructor empowerment, transparency, privacy, and accessibility guide every decision, ensuring that technology serves education rather than driving it.
