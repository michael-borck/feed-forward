Score: 17/20 (85%) ↑ +3 from Draft 1

how my generation forms and maintains friendships" 
is clear and arguable. It effectively previews your 
main points about online vs. offline relationships.

Strengths:
✓ Clear, specific claim
✓ Arguable position
✓ Sets up essay structure

Area for Improvement:
• Consider adding why this matters to make the 
  thesis more compelling

Add a "so what" element: "...friendships, creating 
both new opportunities for connection and unexpected 
challenges for authentic relationships."
```

improved significantly. The example about your 
online gaming friendship (paragraph 3) effectively

Strengths:
✓ Mix of personal and researched evidence

Areas for Improvement:

## Types of Feedback

### Strengths Recognition

Feedback highlights what you're doing well:

```
🌟 Key Strengths Identified:

1. Organization
   "Your essay follows a clear chronological structure 
   that effectively guides readers through your 
   experience with online friendships."

2. Voice and Style
   "Your personal voice comes through authentically, 
   making the narrative engaging and relatable."

3. Introduction
   "The opening anecdote immediately draws readers 
   in and sets up your thesis naturally."
```

### Constructive Criticism

Areas for improvement with specific guidance:

```
🔧 Areas for Improvement:

1. Conclusion (Moderate Priority)
   Current: "Your conclusion restates the thesis but 
   doesn't synthesize your insights or look forward."
   
   Suggestion: "Try ending with reflection on how 
   understanding these changes helps you navigate 
   both online and offline relationships. What have 
   you learned? How will you apply it?"
   
   Example: "Understanding how social media has 
   changed friendship hasn't made me delete my 
   accounts—it's helped me use them more intentionally, 
   balancing digital connection with face-to-face 
   moments that technology can't replace."
```

### Specific Examples

Feedback references your actual text:

```
📍 Specific Text References:

Paragraph 3, Lines 4-6:
Your text: "Me and my friend Jake met in a game 
and we talk every day even though we never met 
in real life."

Feedback: "This example effectively illustrates 
your point about online friendships. Consider 
revising for grammar: 'Jake and I met in a game. 
We talk every day, even though we've never met 
in person.'"

Why this change?
- Correct pronoun case (Jake and I)
- Fix run-on sentence
- More formal tone ('in person' vs 'in real life')
```
