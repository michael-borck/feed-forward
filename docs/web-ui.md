I've created HTML versions of several key mockups from our design, each implemented using Tailwind CSS as recommended in our technical specification:

1. **Student Dashboard** - Shows the student's active assignments and detailed feedback view
2. **My Submissions** - Displays all the student's assignments across courses with filtering
3. **Feedback History** - Shows progress analytics and recurring feedback patterns
4. **Instructor Dashboard** - The main instructor view with course list and assignment management
5. **Add Course Dialog** - Modal for instructors to create new courses
6. **Import Students Dialog** - Interface for uploading student rosters via CSV/TSV

These HTML implementations:
- Follow the visual designs from our SVG mockups
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (as specified in the tech stack)
- Are structured to work well with the FastHTML/HTMX approach
- Include all key components and functionality

These HTML files can serve as direct templates for your FastHTML implementation. With FastHTML, you would:

1. Replace static content with template variables:
   ```html
   <!-- Static HTML -->
   <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Research Essay - Draft 2 Feedback</h2>
   
   <!-- FastHTML version -->
   <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">{{ assignment.title }} - Draft {{ current_draft.number }} Feedback</h2>
   ```

2. Add HTMX attributes for interactivity:
   ```html
   <!-- Button that loads content without page refresh -->
   <button hx-get="/assignments/{{ assignment.id }}/drafts/{{ draft.id }}" 
           hx-target="#feedback-content"
           class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md">
     View Draft {{ draft.number }}
   </button>
   ```

3. Convert repeated elements to loops:
   ```html
   <!-- FastHTML loop syntax -->
   {% for assignment in active_assignments %}
     <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3 mb-4">
       <!-- Assignment content using variables -->
     </div>
   {% endfor %}
   ```

These HTML files provide ready-to-use templates that can be integrated directly into your FastHTML/FastAPI application, significantly reducing the development time for the frontend portion of your MVP.
