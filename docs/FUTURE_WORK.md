# FeedForward Future Work

This document captures ideas and improvements for future development of FeedForward.

## AI Integration Enhancements

### Advanced Aggregation Methods
- **Voting-based consensus**: Implement majority voting for categorical feedback
- **Confidence-weighted voting**: Weight model outputs by their confidence scores
- **Hierarchical aggregation**: Group models by type/strength for multi-level aggregation

### Model Performance & Selection
- **Performance tracking**: Track model accuracy/helpfulness over time
- **A/B testing framework**: Compare models on same assignments
- **Automatic model selection**: Choose best models based on assignment type and past performance
- **Model ensembles**: Custom weighted combinations of models

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Side-by-side comparisons**: Show individual model outputs in columns
- **Model-specific insights**: Highlight unique strengths of each model
- **Confidence visualization**: Show confidence levels for feedback
- **Feedback history**: Track how feedback quality improves over iterations

## Assessment Type Extensibility

### Currently Planned Assessment Types
1. **Code Assessment**
   - Support for multiple programming languages
   - Syntax highlighting and code review features
   - Test case execution and results
   - Code quality metrics

2. **Math/LaTeX Assessment**
   - Mathematical expression rendering
   - Step-by-step solution validation
   - Formula checking

3. **Multimedia Assessment**
   - Video submission and analysis
   - Audio/speech assessment
   - Image/diagram evaluation
   - Presentation assessment
