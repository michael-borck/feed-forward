# ADR 000: Using Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As FeedForward evolves, we need a way to document important architectural decisions, their context, and rationale. Without proper documentation:

- New team members struggle to understand why certain design choices were made
- Design decisions may be reversed without understanding their original purpose
- Institutional knowledge is lost when team members leave the project
- Cross-cutting concerns may not be consistently addressed

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the FeedForward project. An ADR is a short text document that captures an important architectural decision, its context, and its consequences.

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when a decision:
- Has a significant impact on the system architecture
- Affects multiple components or stakeholders
- Represents a trade-off between competing concerns
- Establishes a pattern or convention to be followed
- Is difficult to reverse or has long-term implications
- Would benefit from clear explanation for future developers

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create an ADR for:
- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary solutions that will be replaced soon
- Purely stylistic preferences
- Decisions that follow established patterns

### ADR Format

Each ADR will follow this format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title prefixed with an incremental number
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: Problem being addressed and relevant factors
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: Resulting context after applying the decision (positive and negative)
6. **Implementation**: Key aspects of implementing the decision (optional)

### ADR Storage

ADRs will be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory, with filenames following the pattern `NNN-title-with-hyphens.md`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- New team members can quickly understand key architectural decisions
- Decisions are made with more care since they must be documented
- Provides a historical record of the architecture's evolution
- Helps prevent revisiting decisions without good cause
- Creates a useful reference during system maintenance and enhancement

### Negative

- Additional effort required to create and maintain ADRs
- Risk of creating too many or too few ADRs
- May become outdated if not maintained properly

## Examples of Topics Warranting an ADR in FeedForward

- Authentication strategy (email verification vs. SSO)
- Data persistence choices
- API design principles
- Handling of sensitive data (like API keys)
- Feedback generation and aggregation strategy
- Multi-tenancy approach
- Scalability considerations
- Integration with external systems
- Significant UI/UX paradigms
