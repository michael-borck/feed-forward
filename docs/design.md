## Core Design Principles

### ðŸŽ¯ Educational First
Every feature is designed to enhance the learning experience, focusing on formative feedback that guides improvement rather than just grading.

### ðŸ”’ Privacy by Design
Student work is treated with respect - submissions are processed temporarily and not permanently stored.

### ðŸ¤– AI as Assistant, Not Replacement
AI augments instructor capabilities rather than replacing human judgment. All feedback can be reviewed and modified.

### ðŸ“Š Evidence-Based
Feedback is structured around rubrics and learning objectives, providing clear, actionable guidance.

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Learning
Students can submit multiple drafts, encouraging revision and improvement based on feedback.
