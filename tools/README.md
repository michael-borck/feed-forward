## üìÅ Archive Directory

The `archive/` directory contains scripts that were used during development but are not typically needed for regular operations:

### One-time Migration Scripts
- Database migration scripts (`migrate_*.py`)
- Code refactoring utilities (`fix_*.py`, `refactor_*.py`)

## üìù Adding New Tools

When adding new utility scripts:
1. Include comprehensive docstrings
2. Add error handling and logging
3. Test thoroughly before committing
4. Update this README with description and usage
5. Consider if the script should be archived after one-time use
